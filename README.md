# BetterDuStryMod
### Introduction
This mod is an amalgamation of EU and ET. However, in addition it adds new blocks and rebalances existing blocks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mod does not shamelessly steal other people's sprites without their authors' permission to use them.

Special thanks to `#454545`Snake#2132 for the ability to use weapon sprites for units:
- ship-cannon - is based on the "parity-unit-launcher"
- aa-ship-weapon - original sprite "point-laser-mount"
