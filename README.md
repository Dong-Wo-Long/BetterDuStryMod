# Oh dear, if there are those willing to help with mod development..... I just really need spriters. I can't do this anymore - I need quality, not my hackwork

### Introduction
This mod is an amalgamation of EU and ET. However, in addition it adds new blocks and rebalances existing blocks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### The mod does not shamelessly steal other people's sprites without their author's permission to use them.
### Sapphirium

Special thanks to Snake#2132 for the ability to use weapon sprites for units:
- ship-large-cannon - is based on the "tornado-cyclone"
- ship-cannon - is based on the "parity-unit-launcher"
- aa-ship-weapon - original sprite "point-laser-mount"
- ship-rail-rig - redesigned from “whirlpool-launcher”

### Asthosus
