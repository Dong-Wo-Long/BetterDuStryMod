# So, I might have to rework some things in the mod... I hope the balance doesn't go to hell? Then again, what's the difference? The gameplay experience is what matters most, preferably not a completely shitty one

> [!WARNING]  
> A lot of errors have been found in the mod - from now on, its current version becomes "experimental"
> Until critical, and less significant, problems and errors are resolved, the mod will have this given status
> So install it at your own risk, knowing that it is partially or completely broken

### Introduction
This mod is an amalgamation of EU and ET. However, in addition it adds new blocks and rebalances existing blocks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### The mod does not shamelessly steal other people's sprites without their author's permission to use them.
### Sapphirium

Special thanks to Snake#2132 for the ability to use weapon sprites for units:
- ship-large-cannon - is based on the "tornado-cyclone"
- ship-cannon - is based on the "parity-unit-launcher"
- aa-ship-weapon - original sprite "point-laser-mount"
- ship-rail-rig - redesigned from “whirlpool-launcher”

### Asthosus
